- 👋 Hi, I’m @JibPurin
- 👀 I’m interested in making roguelike games!
- 🌱 I’m currently joining RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing? I'm new here and just want to version control my 1st roguelike project
- 📫 How to reach me : I'm not sure if git has messaging function or not but I will guess that it has one, so message me I guess?
